# 3D Data Visualization with Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib

This Python script demonstrates how to perform 3D data visualization using the pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib libraries. It includes examples of scatter plots, parametric curves, and surface plots in 3D space.

## Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## Usage:

1. Ensure Python and the required libraries are installed on your system.
2. Place the script in the same directory as the CSV file you want to visualize.
3. Modify the script to read the desired CSV file by updating the filename in the `pd.read_csv()` function.
4. Run the script.

## Description:

1. **Reading Data**:
   - The script reads data from a CSV file using the pandas library and stores it in a DataFrame.

2. **Data Manipulation**:
   - It performs calculations on the data, such as calculating differences between columns and computing moving averages.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Scatter Plot in 3D: Creates a 3D scatter plot using data from the DataFrame.
   - Parametric Curve in 3D: Generates a parametric curve in 3D space using trigonometric functions.
   - 3D Surface Plot: Creates a 3D surface plot using a custom-defined function to calculate z-values based on x and y inputs.

## Note:

- This script is intended for educational purposes and to demonstrate the capabilities of 3D data visualization using Python libraries.
